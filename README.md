# learnk8s

## What's this about

This is where I document my investigations into various things more or less related to running applications on Kubernetes. It's basically an open collection of my notes.

The formula is simple: I do an investigation into a subject, for example: how does the flux [soure controller](flux/2-source-controller.md) work?
I usually dive into some documentation, document what trouble I run into trying to apply the steps, look at logs and application code. I state assumptions about how things will work and try to confirm these. Sometime things work differently than expected, which is fine. Some of these documents see me moving back and forth trying to get things to work.

## Structure

I separate the investigations into areas such as `flux`, `grafana`, `k8s` and `postgres`.
In [topics.md](topics.md) I collect topics that I'm interested in investigating in the future.
